# Function-Specific Review Workflow (JS/TS)

## Purpose
Perform a deep, skeptical review of each major function/hook/module changed.

## Steps
1. Evaluate function against checklist: readability, complexity, naming, dependencies, and testability.
2. Measure cyclomatic complexity and recommend refactors if above threshold.
3. Suggest API simplifications and clearer signatures.
4. Provide minimal example rewrites when helpful.

## Deliverable
- Inline comments and a short report summarizing issues and suggested fixes.
